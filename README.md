## Prerequisits
In order to be able to use the "[build.sh](./build.sh)"-script you must manually provide the path to your LibTorch distribution. For further reading on how to optain a LibTorch distribution, consult the PyTorch documentation (s. [https://docs.pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html](https://docs.pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html)). A helpful resource is the link selector available at [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
